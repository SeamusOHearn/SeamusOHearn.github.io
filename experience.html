                    <p> Seamus is a hard working and all around good person. Never have I seen anything less than an amazing personality come out of Seamus in even the worst of times, he always keeps his head up and moves forward. I was in the end of my program as Seamus was in the early parts of his, his work ethic and character only got better over time. I would recommend Seamus to where ever he chose to apply. </p>
