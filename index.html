                    Hi, my name is Seamus and I’m currently a software engineering student at Florida Gulf Coast University. Growing up I always enjoyed solving problems. Whether I was presented with a puzzle or a riddle, I was always up for the challenge and found joy in solving the problem. So naturally when I was first introduced to programming with Python during a class for my first degree, in computer animation, I was instantly hooked. It took a few years before I made the decision to return to school to learn more about this passion, but I’ve been loving every moment since.

                    <br>
                    When I’m not behind a computer desk working on anything, I am usually out on my kayak fishing. I'm lucky that the local waters here in Fort Myers, Florida have a vast variety of fish species to target as well as mostly calm waters compared to the other side of the state. I prefer fishing from a kayak over fishing from land or power boats because it’s a lot more peaceful, and I can get into areas you can’t take a normal boat and can’t access from shore.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If you have any questions about any of my current or past projects, or want to chat about fishing, feel free to reach out to me through any of the ways listed on my <a href="./contact.html"> contact page. </a>
